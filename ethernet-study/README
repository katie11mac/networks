Part II: Binary Exponential Backoff
Instructions: Run binary exponential backoff with N = 10, N = 20, N = 40, and N = 80, and hypothesize how the delay incurred by collisions scales with N. 

To hypothesize how the delay incurred by collisions scales with N, I first ran the binary exponential backoff ten times with each specified number of devices. Then I took their averages. 

N = 10 
	Delay Times: 33, 78, 40, 42, 42, 50, 73, 66, 53, 50
	Average Delay: 53

N = 20
	Delay Times: 98, 94, 67, 89, 152, 331, 74, 106, 90, 104
	Average Delay: 120

N = 40 
	Delay Times: 326, 334, 176, 364, 231, 311, 324, 285, 605, 283
	Average Delay: 324

N = 80
	Delay Times: 869, 1146, 853, 597, 909, 749, 1023, 1373, 2522, 878
	Average Delay: 1092

With these numbers, I then worked to find the equation of a line that best fits these points. Since the points when graphed looked like it would fit a quadratic equation, I used that to help find a reasonable relationship between the delay and number of devices N. 

I'm unsure of this relationship, but ultimately I found that the delay scales at around 0.15N^2+2N.

Part III: Hubs vs Switches 
Instructions: Find the percentage of frames that were successfully delivered by the hub and switch with N = 10, N = 20, and N = 40 devices. Run your tests 5 times, for 1000 timeslots each, and average the results. 


These are my results of conducting the experiments specified in the instructions. 

Hub Results 
	N = 10
	Percent Frames Delivered: 0.098658%, 0.302786%, 0.117440%, 0.078989%, 0.239904%
	Average Percent: 0.1675554%

	N = 20 
	Percent Frames Delivered: 0.000000%, 0.000000%, 0.000000%, 0.000000%, 0.000000% 
	Average Percent: 0%

	N = 40 
	Percent Frames Delivered: 0.000000%, 0.000000%, 0.000000%, 0.000000%, 0.000000%
	Average Percent: 0%


Switch Results
	N = 10 
	Percent Frames Delivered: 62.033898%, 63.355892%, 65.886748%, 63.434343%, 64.130435%
	Average Percent: 63.7682632%

	N = 20 
	Percent Frames Delivered: 61.750828%, 62.067245%, 62.249320%, 61.703413%, 61.517884%
	Average Percent: 61.857738%

	N = 40 
	Percent Frames Delivered: 61.601602%, 61.601602%, 61.407779%, 61.423657%, 61.095739% 
	Average Percent: 61.4260758%

The results of these tests show us how a switch is more reliable and consistent than a hub. Based on these results, it looks like a switch has a good chance of successfully delivering at least 60% of created frames.
