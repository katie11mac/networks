Assignment 2, Part II: Run binary exponential backoff with N = 10, N = 20, N = 40, and N = 80, and hypothesize how the delay incurred by collisions scales with N. 

To hypothesize how the delay incurred by collisions scales with N, I first ran the binary exponential backoff ten times with each specified number of devices. Then I took their averages. 

N = 10 
Delay Times: 33, 78, 40, 42, 42, 50, 73, 66, 53, 50
Average Delay: 53

N = 20
Delay Times: 98, 94, 67, 89, 152, 331, 74, 106, 90, 104
Average Delay: 120

N = 40 
Delay Times: 326, 334, 176, 364, 231, 311, 324, 285, 605, 283
Average Delay: 324

N = 80
Delay Times: 869, 1146, 853, 597, 909, 749, 1023, 1373, 2522, 878
Average Delay: 1092

With these numbers, I then worked to find the equation of a line that best fits these points. Since the points when graphed looked like it would fit a quadratic equation, I used that to help find a reasonable relationship between the delay and number of devices N. 

Ultimately I found that the delay scales at 0.15N^2+2N. ?
